# MT002-Backplane

Modular backplane designed to be compatible with RC2014.

To support additional modules a number of these backplanes can be connected together end to end using right angled dual row 2x40 pin headers and female headers.

The backplane is designed to fit within a 102mm x 102mm printed circuit board.

Top side is ground plane to help reduce RFI and provide a ground for the bus signals.

User defined pins connect only to the adjacent module and are not bussed across the backplane.

Spacing between the modules is non-standard at 0.7 inch between centres, spacing between modules on adjacent backplane modules is not maintained.
